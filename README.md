**_SETTING:_**

Game is based off a scenario, where few people are stuck in space . The space is in utter chaos with killer asteroids coming from all directions making it nearly impossible to get through without getting hit by an aseteroid.

## **_OUTLINE:_**

###### OBJECTIVE:

Space Race has a very simple objective. It is a multiplayer rocket game.
The idea is to get to the top of the map having avoided the space debris/asteroids to gain points and avoid losing points to hitting the floating debris.

###### LOGIC:

Dodging the asteroids/debris enables the player to move forward, whereas getting hit by them causes the player to be brought back to the starting point, thus losing time
to reach the top of the map. Doing one pass without getting struck by obstacles , enables the player to go back to the start point in order to do more passes. Players can continue to complete rounds on the map until the timer runs out.

###### GAME END:

Game ends as soon as the timer bar has completed.
The leaderboard will be constantly updated with the top scores of players from around the world.

###### OBSTACLES:

- Normal debris (consists of various stray meteors)
- Fire meteors, which have a larger radius of attack

###### POINTS SYSTEM:

- For crossing and reaching the top => **+5** points
- For hitting debris => **-1** points
- For hitting fire meteors => **-5** points

###### GAME MECHANICS:

- ###### COLLISIONS =>
  > Any collision between the spaceship and a flying object will trigger the spaceship to respawn to the bottom of the screen and update the respective score.\
- ###### REACHING THE TOP =>
  > Completing one cycle by reaching the top of the map is checked and the points are updated accordingly.
- ###### METEOR SHOWERS =>
  > Timers are in place for meteor showers which have a larger radius of attack.
- ###### SCORE SYSTEM =>
  > A scoring system with a constantly updated leaderboard are in place to track scores.
