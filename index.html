                <strong>Goal:</strong>
                <p>- Player with the most points when the timer's up wins.</p>
                <strong>Setup:</strong>
                <p>
                    - Space is in utter chaos with killer asteroids coming from all directions making it nearly impossible to get through without getting hit by an aseteroid.
                </p>
                <p>- Multiplayer game wherein each player controls a rocket.</p>

                <strong>Objective:</strong>
                <p>
                    - Get to the top of the map by avoiding the space asteroids and meteoroid attacks to make maximum number of passes within the time limit.
                </p>

                <strong>Rules: </strong>
                <p>
                    - Doing one pass without getting struck by obstacles enables the player to go back to the initial position in order to do more passes.
                </p>
                <p>- Game ends as soon as the timer is completed.</p>
                <p>
                    - Winner of the game is the player who has most points (has the most passes).
                </p>
