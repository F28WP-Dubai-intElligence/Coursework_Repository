            <h4>
                Game is based off a scenario, where few people are stuck in space . The space is in utter chaos with killer asteroids coming from all directions making it nearly impossible to get through without getting hit by an aseteroid.
            </h4>

            <br>

            <h4>
                *game name* has a very simple objective,it's a multiplayer game wherein each player controls a rocket. The idea is to get to the top of the map having avoided the space debris/asteroids to gain a point (1 point for passing once). The bar in the middle
                represents the time left for the game to end.
            </h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5> Dodging the asteroids/debris enables the player to move forward, whereas getting hit by them causes the player to be brought back to the starting point, thus losing time to reach the top of the map. Doing one pass without getting struck by
                obstacles , enables the player to go back to the start point in order to do more passes ,thus incrementing a point with each pass.Player can do more and more passes until the time ends.

            </h5>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>Game end: Game ends as soon as the bar in the middle (timer) has completed. Winner of the game is the player who has got most points (has the most passes)</h5>
