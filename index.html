                <b> Players:</b>
                <p>- 3</p>
                <strong>Goal:</strong>
                <p>- Player with the most points when the timer's up wins.</p>
                <strong>Setup:</strong>
                <p>- Space is in utter chaos with killer asteroids coming from all directions making it nearly impossible to get through without getting hit by an aseteroid.</h4>
                    <p>- Multiplayer game wherein each player controls a rocket.</p>

                    <strong>Objective:</strong>
                    <p>- Get to the top of the map by avoiding the space debris/asteroids and make maximum number of passes within the time limit.</p>

                    <strong>Rules: </strong>
                    <p>- Doing one pass without getting struck by obstacles enables the player to go back to the initial position in order to do more passes.</p>
                    <p>- Player can do more and more passes until the time ends.</p>
                    <p>- Game ends as soon as the timer is completed.</p>
                    <p>- Winner of the game is the player who has most points (has the most passes).</p>
